In Spider-Man’s first story, in Marvel Comics’ Amazing Fantasy, no. 15 (1962), American teenager Peter Parker, a poor sickly orphan, is bitten by a radioactive
spider. As a result of the bite, he gains superhuman strength, speed, and agility along with the ability to cling to walls.  As the 1970s continued, Spider-Man’s 
adventures expanded into a fourth ongoing comic series (a monthly intended for the mainstream Spidey audience) titled Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man
(later shortened to The Spectacular Spider-Man), which debuted in December 1976 and ran for 263 issues. This title, along with ASM, would carry the Spider-Man 
franchise through the next two decades.
